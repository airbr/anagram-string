* When it came to choosing a question I had a strong preference for the Anagram String question immediately. Just from reading the questions it seemed the most approachable to make an extendible program for my skill level.

* My initial thought was to set up an environment where I could test the strings in the browser as well as something on the CLI with Node, which lead me to start this repository as a duplication of a strings project in my Github.

* Link to the original strings project: https://github.com/airbr/strings - This Github project about string manipulation is my own work but following instructions from a course released under MIT license at https://learnjavascript.online.

* I found some different answers online to this question early in my search but I continued my search and my answer is my own work in terms of my thought process of writing code and how I would apply what I researched.

* In this example question the concept of Character Maps seemed to be the most important principle, so to make a initial program I focused on making a simple readable way to create a character map and compare two maps to see if they were composed of the same to match.

I consulted with a good friend named Nathan Carnes about my choice of question and also an initial review of this repository as it exists on GitHub
