* Choosing a question. Strong preference for the Anagram String question just from reading the questions it seemed the most approachable to make an extendible program for my skill level.

* My initial thought process was to set up an environment where I could test the strings in the browser as well as something on the CLI with Node, which lead me to start this repository as a duplication of the strings project.

* Strings project https://github.com/airbr/strings - This Github project about string manipulation is my own work but following instructions from a course released under MIT license at https://learnjavascript.online
