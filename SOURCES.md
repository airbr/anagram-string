When it came to choosing a question I had a strong preference for the anagram string question immediately. Just from reading the questions it seemed the most approachable to make an extendable program for my skill level.

My initial thought was to set up an environment where I could test the strings in the browser as well as something on the CLI with Node, which lead me to start this repository as a duplicate of a strings project on my Github: https://github.com/airbr/strings . The Strings Github project is my own work but was made following instructions from a course released under MIT license at https://learnjavascript.online.

I found some different answers online to this question early in my search which I have documented below. My answer is my own work and reflects my thought process of writing code to answer the question although it overlaps some with resources consulted in the sources section - this seemed unavoidable. 

In this example question the concept of character maps seemed to be the most important principle so to make a initial program I focused on making a simple readable implementation of a character map that I anticipate some changes to.

More broadly speaking the concept of a character map seems important for other use cases than just anagrams so I really enjoyed learning about it through this question.

I consulted with a good friend named Nathan Carnes about my choice of question and also an initial review of this repository as it exists on GitHub
